1. <u>Protect the sprained ankle</u> <br />
This is quite simple, but amazingly common for people to forget. Don't walk on the sprained ankle, and protect it from further contact by immobilizing with a splint or brace. <br />
<br />
2. <u>REST</u> <br />
Take a few days off of your feet. You don't have to be inactive, but be sure the ankle is being rested. Possible exercises you can do include swimming and cycling. <br />
<br />
3. <u>ICE</u> <br />
This can be done several times a day for 15-20 minutes. This will keep the swelling to a minimum. Do NOT ice for more than 20 minutes, it will do more damage than good. <br />
<br />
4. <u>COMPRESSION</u> <br />
This does not have to be all of the time, but particularly when your foot is not elevated it would be advisable. A simple Ace wrap is fine for light compression. <br />
<br />
5. <u>ELEVATE</u> <br />
This will also help to minimize the swelling that takes place. A few pillows under the ankle should be fine to get the leg up enough while keeping the injured limb comfortable. <br />
<br />
6. <u>Seek professional help when needed</u> <br />
While most ankle injuries are simple and heal naturally over a short time, some injuries are more severe and can necessitate more aggressive treatment. <br />
